** RSeQC - An RNA-Seq Quality Metric App **

-----------------------------------------


This app implements selected packages from the [RSeQC suite](http://code.google.com/p/rseqc/wiki/Manual).  These are:

* geneBody_coverage
* inner_distance
* junction_annotation
* read_distribution
* read_duplication

The app requires as input RNA-Seq mappings and a BED file describing the gene model used for or derived from these mappings.

The output is a set of charts in a report that can be viewed by selecting the report object in the data browser.
